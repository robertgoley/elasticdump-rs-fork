# Security: dependency advisories and image CVEs

This file tracks every advisory and image CVE that the scanners below report for searchdump, with
its status. Status values:

- **open**: affects a shipped artifact and has no fix yet;
- **resolved**: fixed, and the "Resolved in" column says where;
- **not-affected**: present, with a justification.

Code and supply-chain findings (F-01…F-14, INJ-F1…F4) are mapped to their fixes and regression tests in [Code and supply-chain findings](#code-and-supply-chain-findings-sup-018).

Related docs: [TESTING-MATRIX.md](TESTING-MATRIX.md) and [NODE-DIFFERENCES.md](NODE-DIFFERENCES.md).

## Status summary

Counts below are taken from the sections in this file (High+Critical image findings unless noted). "Won't-fix (accepted)" means a Debian/DHI won't-fix or not-fixed High finding that is documented here and ignored by `make scan` only while that fix state lasts. "Open" means a finding on that image that is not accepted for shipping that image.

| Artifact | Open | Resolved | Won't-fix (accepted) | Not-affected |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cargo.lock (Rust dependencies) | 0 | 41 | 0 | 0 |
| `dhi-debian` (default `make image` since L-810c) | 0 | 1 (CVE-2026-109518 in apt, fixed by the `94571f3d…` base) | 19 | 0 |
| `dhi-static` (default from L-808b to L-810c) | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 |
| `dhi-alpine` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Public Alpine (`make image-alpine`) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (CVE-2025-60876, Medium, busybox `wget`) |
| Public Debian (`make image-public`) | 15 High (this base is not recommended) | 0 | 15 are Debian won't-fix / not-fixed; still open if this image is shipped | 0 |

The 15 public-Debian High CVEs are the same kind of base-OS won't-fix findings; they stay **open on that base** because that image is not an accepted default. Choosing Alpine or a dhi.io base avoids them.

CVE-2026-109518 is gone; remaining High findings are the accepted won't-fix set. Later pushes on `main` also passed the same workflow: 42998301407 (`800ff96` push), 43070931258 (`e1a0f8e`), 43071665377 (`f38af3f`), 43077967669 (`94e4afb`), 43085265717 (`a98be22`) |

## Scanning method

- **Rust dependencies**
  - `cargo audit` (RustSec database, fetched at scan time) reads Cargo.lock, which is committed.
  - `cargo deny check advisories bans licenses sources` uses [deny.toml](deny.toml):
    - advisories: yanked, unmaintained and unsound crates are all errors;
    - licenses: an explicit allow list;
    - bans: wildcard versions are denied, duplicate versions only warn;
    - sources: crates.io only.
  - CI runs `cargo audit --deny warnings`, so a new unmaintained or unsound warning also fails the job.
- **Container image**
  - `make save` writes `image.tar`; `make scan` runs `grype -c docker/grype-ignore.yaml --fail-on high` and `trivy --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1` on it. For `IMAGE_VARIANT=dhi-debian` (L-810e) it uses `docker/grype-ignore.dhi-debian.yaml` and `--ignorefile docker/trivyignore.dhi-debian.yaml` instead.
  - Both scanners see the OS packages only. The Rust binary is not built with `cargo auditable`, so they cannot see the crates inside it; cargo-audit covers those.
- **SBOMs**
  - `make sbom` uses syft to write `sbom-image.cdx.json` (CycloneDX) and `sbom-image.spdx.json` (SPDX).
  - CI also runs `cargo cyclonedx` to produce the crate SBOM (`sbom-cargo.cdx.json`).
  - SBOMs are uploaded as workflow artifacts and are not committed.
- **CI**
  - [.github/workflows/security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml) runs on push to `main`/`rewrite`, on manual dispatch, and weekly.
  - It fails on any RustSec advisory or warning, a cargo-deny violation, or a HIGH/CRITICAL image CVE.
  - It never logs in to push and never publishes images. The dhi.io login is pull-only and is used for the `dhi*` bases (the default `base=dhi` is the static glibc image; `base=dhi-alpine` the Alpine one).
- **Reproduce locally**
  - `cargo audit`
  - `cargo deny check advisories bans licenses sources`
  - `make image-alpine scan sbom`

Related cargo-deny finding:

- **License: tiny-keccak 2.0.2 is CC0-1.0.**
  - It reaches the build through rust-ini → ordered-multimap → dlv-list → const-random.
  - CC0-1.0 is a permissive public-domain dedication, so it was added to the allow list in deny.toml.
  - Commit: ae2531f.

| `make image-alpine` | `docker.io/library/rust:1.99.1-alpine3.24` | `docker.io/library/alpine:3.24.3`, plus the same apk steps | musl / musl | 0 |

**How the default was fixed: dhi.io tag choice plus Dockerfile changes.**

- **Before.** The dhi.io Debian 13 `-dev` runtime (`trixie-debian13-dev`) was the default and was scanned as built, before any change. The results are in the dhi.io Debian table below.
  - The `-dev` variant brings apt, gpgv, perl-base, util-linux, ncurses, pam, systemd libraries and tar.
  - Debian marks every one of these findings `wont-fix` or `not-fixed`, and the image carries the same Debian package versions (`+dhiN` rebuilds).
  - So no Debian-based tag can clear them. `dhi.io/debian-base` only has the `trixie*` tags (`trixie`, `trixie-debian13`, `-dev`, `-fips`, `-fips-dev`, `-kit`), with no dated tags. The non-dev tags have no bash.
  - `dhi.io/bash:5.2.37-debian13-dev` is worse: 14 Critical and 70 High (grype).
- **Alternatives scanned on their own.**
  - `dhi.io/bash:5-alpine3.24-dev` has 2 High (curl/libcurl, which it ships).
  - `dhi.io/alpine-base:3.24-alpine3.24-dev` has only one Unknown finding: musl CVE-2026-107891, fixed upstream.
- **After.** The default moved to Alpine/musl dhi.io images, with a matching dhi.io musl builder, `dhi.io/rust:1.99.0-alpine3.23-dev`. That is the newest Alpine Rust tag on dhi.io; dhi.io has no `1.99.1-alpine` tag.
- **Dockerfile changes for Alpine runtimes.**
  - `apk upgrade --no-cache` picks up musl 1.2.6-r3, the fix for CVE-2026-107891.
  - `apk add bash ca-certificates libgcc` adds the shell and the CA bundle. `libgcc` is there because Alpine-packaged rustc links `libgcc_s` dynamically.
  - The packages come from the image's own repositories, `https://dhi.io/apk/alpine/v3.24/main` (no credentials needed inside the build), so they are recorded in the apk database and stay visible to scanners.
  - `CARGO_HOME=/usr/local/cargo` is pinned so the registry cache mount works with the Alpine-packaged cargo.
- **Size.** The image is ~20 MB, versus ~90 MB on dhi.io Debian.
- **Credentials.** The dhi.io credentials stay in podman's auth file on the build host. `podman history` shows no login or auth step, and there is no `auth.json`/`config.json` in the image.

### Alpine image (`make image-alpine`)

| ID | Component | Severity | Status | Justification / resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2025-60876 | busybox 1.37.0-r31, busybox-binsh, ssl_client | Medium (grype, CVSS 6.5); trivy does not report it | not-affected; no Alpine fix yet | The flaw is in the busybox `wget` applet (and `ssl_client`, which only `wget` uses). Nothing in the image calls `wget`: the tool does HTTP itself through reqwest/rustls, and the entrypoint is the Rust binary. Re-check at the next scan. |

### dhi.io static glibc (`make image-dhi-static`; the default from L-808b to L-810c)

L-808b made the glibc + mimalloc build the default image at the user's request. Of the dhi.io glibc runtimes,
`dhi.io/static:20250419-glibc-debian13` has the fewest findings (comparison above and in `results/local/L-808b.md`): it ships
only `base-files`, `ca-certificates`, `libc6`, `libgcc-s1` and `tzdata`, with no shell or package manager. trivy reports no
HIGH/CRITICAL finding; grype rates five CVEs High that trivy rates MEDIUM. All five are Debian `wont-fix` / `not-fixed`,
Status: **accepted, open** (user decision 2026-11-01, L-808d): the default stays on this base, and the five CVEs are
accepted as known while no fix exists. `make scan` ignores exactly these five ids through
[`docker/grype-ignore.yaml`](docker/grype-ignore.yaml): each rule names one CVE id and its package, and matches only
while grype reports the fix state as `not-fixed` or `wont-fix`. When Debian/DHI publish a fix, the state becomes
`fixed`, no rule matches and `make scan` fails again; then update the base pin and drop the rule. Revisit when Debian
or DHI publishes a fix (check at every scan). The Alpine image (`make image-dhi-alpine`, `:<ver>-alpine`) has none of
them.

| CVE | Package | Severity (grype / trivy) | Debian status | Fix | Accepted | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-19499 | libc6 2.41-12+deb13u4+dhi1 | High / MEDIUM | wont-fix | no fix available | 2026-11-01 (L-808d), revisit when Debian/DHI publishes a fix | also in every Debian 13 base below |

### dhi.io Debian 13 `-dev` (`make image`, the default since L-810c)

Image type `dhi-debian`: builder `dhi.io/rust:1.99.1-debian13-dev`, runtime `dhi.io/debian-base:trixie-debian13-dev`
(shell, apt). It became the default image in L-810c (owner decision 2026-11-11, pt146u). It was already built as
`make image-dhi-debian` before that and failed `make scan`.

**L-810e (owner decision 2026-11-11).**
- **Base refresh.** The runtime pin moves from `sha256:cc4e05ff…` (old) to the index digest
  `sha256:94571f3dc07fbc7166f6f1cbf1fe068a7647198ee2554e6b90d59a68cc8b053c`.
  - That is the `trixie-debian13-dev` tag as listed in the Docker Hub DHI catalog on 2026-11-11, pushed 2026-11-08.
  - Per-platform manifests: amd64 `sha256:da8ceb0d…`, arm64 `sha256:27f54125…`.
  - Its package list has `apt` and `libapt-pkg7.0` 3.0.4+dhi0, which fixes **CVE-2026-109518** (the only fixable
    High finding, in apt 3.0.3+dhi2); status **resolved in L-810e**.
- **Accepted CVEs.** Every remaining High finding is Debian/DHI won't-fix and is accepted below. Each one has a
  scoped rule that applies only to this image type (`IMAGE_VARIANT=dhi-debian`):
  - grype, in [`docker/grype-ignore.dhi-debian.yaml`](docker/grype-ignore.dhi-debian.yaml): one rule per CVE id
    and Debian package, matched only while the fix state is `wont-fix`, with anchored package names;
  - trivy, in [`docker/trivyignore.dhi-debian.yaml`](docker/trivyignore.dhi-debian.yaml): CVE id plus package purls.
- **Other images are unaffected.** `make scan` uses these files only for dhi-debian; every other image keeps
  `docker/grype-ignore.yaml` and plain trivy.
- **Revisit trigger, for every entry.**
  - Debian/DHI publish a fix: grype's fix state leaves `wont-fix`, the rule stops matching and `make scan` fails.
  - Or a new base digest changes the package set.
  - Or searchdump starts executing or linking the affected component.
  - Then refresh the pin, re-scan and drop the rule.
- **Review date** for every entry: 2026-11-11.

**Why none of these is reachable from searchdump.**
- **What the binaries use.** `searchdump` and `searchdump-multi` are Rust binaries. In the image they link only
  `libc.so.6`, `libm.so.6` and `libgcc_s.so.1` (`ldd`, 2026-11-11). They execute no program from the image;
  `searchdump-multi` runs only `searchdump`.
- **How they run.** As uid 65532 (nonroot). The image's only setuid/setgid file is `unix_chkpwd`. No daemon runs:
  the entrypoint is `searchdump`.
- **What the CVEs are in.** The other packages are part of the base image's shell and package-manager userland,
  present because this type keeps a shell:
  - the vulnerable programs (`infocmp`, `nsenter`, `gpgv`, `perl`, apt's tools) are only reached if someone runs
    them inside the container;
  - the vulnerable libraries (libstdc++, libsqlite3, libacl, libsystemd, libudev) are not loaded by searchdump.
- **For deployments that don't need a shell.** Use the `dhi-static` image (5 accepted libc6/libgcc-s1 CVEs,
  section above) or `dhi-alpine` (0).

The package versions in the table are those of the image scanned locally on 2026-11-11 (built on the previous digest,
`cc4e05ff…`). The new digest could not be pulled on the review host (no dhi.io login). The confirming CI `make scan`
on `sha256:94571f3d…` passed (run 42998300960 and the later `main` runs listed under [Last scan](#last-scan)). If a
new base adds a High CVE or changes a fix state, that scan fails and the new finding needs an entry here first.

### Debian 13 public fallback (`make image-public`)

- All 157 grype matches are Debian `wont-fix` or `not-fixed`, so none can be fixed by upgrading packages.
- The HIGH/CRITICAL findings are listed below (15 distinct CVEs, grouped by CVE).
- They come from the base OS (util-linux, glibc, gcc runtime libs, ncurses, perl-base, zlib, acl, systemd libs). They do not come from searchdump.
- The binary links only glibc (libc, libm) and libgcc_s. Even so, glibc CVE-2026-19499 and CVE-2026-5435 cannot be ruled out for a dynamically linked program, which is why this base is not recommended.
- Status: **open on this base**, and resolved by choosing another base: the Alpine/musl build or the dhi.io base.

## Code and supply-chain findings (SUP-018)

These are the review findings in TEST-REQUIREMENTS.md §7.3 (F-01…F-14) and §8 (INJ-F1…F4). Each one has a regression test or lint that fails on the code before the fix. Status values are the same as above. Workflow fixes are lint-verified only, because this fork is never pushed and the workflows cannot run here.

| F-14 | Images pulled by tag | resolved | 17b16d7 | `scripts/lint-hygiene.sh` F-14 (Makefile, Dockerfile, compose, `scripts/it/images.lock`) |

The stray `oom` file: no code path in `src/`, `tests/` or `scripts/` writes it (no such literal in any commit). The committed copy predates the first commit by 6 seconds, so it came from an ad-hoc shell redirect. `scripts/check-clean-tree.sh` catches any test that writes into the tree.

## Decisions and follow-ups

- **Default base.** Since L-808b the default is the glibc + mimalloc build on `dhi.io/static:20250419-glibc-debian13` (`make image`, `scripts/build-image.sh`), chosen by the user for glibc; it has 5 grype-High findings in glibc / libgcc-s with no fix, accepted by the user on 2026-11-01 (L-808d) as known and open until upstream ships fixes; `make scan` ignores exactly those five ids while their fix state is `not-fixed`/`wont-fix` (`docker/grype-ignore.yaml`), so a published fix fails the scan again. The dhi.io Alpine build (`make image-dhi-alpine`, `:<ver>-alpine`) scans clean and stays available. CI needs the repository secrets `DHI_USERNAME`/`DHI_TOKEN` (pull-only token, not committed). Without them, dispatch with `base=alpine`. `make image-dhi-debian` and `make image-public` are kept, but they fail `make scan`.
- **musl vs glibc.** The default binary and image are glibc + mimalloc (L-808b); the release workflow also builds static musl binaries, and the Alpine image is musl. The full integration matrix runs the host (glibc) build; both images were verified with `scripts/test-image.sh` and a dump/restore against OpenSearch 2.19.7 (L-808b for the glibc image).
- **MSRV.** No advisory needed an MSRV bump once the `elasticsearch` dev-dependency was removed. If `time` comes back into the tree, its fix (0.3.47) needs Rust 1.88.
- **Image visibility into the binary's crates.** Building with `cargo auditable` would let grype and trivy see the crates inside the binary. It is not adopted yet; cargo-audit on the committed Cargo.lock covers those crates instead.
