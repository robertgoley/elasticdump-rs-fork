# Changelog

All notable changes to searchdump-rs. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/);
a version with a hyphen (`1.0.0-beta1`) is a pre-release. The release workflow
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) uses the section for a version as the release notes of its draft
GitHub release.

## Unreleased (1.1)

Draft on the local `release/1.1` branch (roadmap: `FEATURES-TODO.md`, "Roadmap: 1.1
release"; order: `project/plan/ROADMAP-1.1-PLAN.md`). Not tagged and not yet
performance-measured. The user-facing notes, including the upgrade guide, are in
[`project/release/RELEASE-NOTES-1.1.md`](project/release/RELEASE-NOTES-1.1.md).

### Disclaimer

searchdump-rs is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, as stated in the MIT license
(the same warranty disclaimer as the elasticdump-rs code it derives from; Node elasticdump,
whose behaviour it follows, has the equivalent disclaimer in Apache-2.0, sections 7 and 8).
The authors are not liable for any damage from its use, including data loss, corruption,
downtime or service disruption, in production or elsewhere. It has been stable and fast in
our testing, but no test suite covers every cluster version, configuration, plugin and
storage backend. Test in a non-production environment first, and verify every backup and
restore yourself (restore it, compare document counts) before you rely on it. See
[Disclaimer](README.md#disclaimer).

### Added

- **`--refreshInterval=<seconds>`** (default `5`). Refresh written indices at most this often
  while writing, plus once at the end of the run. Accepts seconds, optional decimals, and an
  optional trailing `s` (`0` to `86400`). `0` restores a refresh after every batch.
- **`--scrollDocSort`** (opt-in, default off). Adds `"sort":["_doc"]` to an unscored scroll
  body that has no user sort.
- **`--sliceCap=auto|min|total|false`** (default `auto`; `true` is an alias of `auto`) and
  **`--sliceField=<field>`**. A scroll dump caps `--slices` to the primary-shard count unless
  `--sliceCap=false`; `auto` uses the total count on Elasticsearch 7.11-9.4 and the smallest
  count on Elasticsearch 5.0-7.10, 9.5+, OpenSearch and undetectable versions. `--sliceField`
  slices on a numeric or date field with doc values.
- **`searchdump-multi --verifyCounts`**. Always re-read dumped or loaded data and fail the
  index when the child's reported record count differs.

### Changed

- **Refresh cadence (1.1-1).** The writer used to refresh the target after every bulk batch, as
  Node elasticdump does. It now refreshes the indices it wrote at most every 5 seconds (the
  clock starts at the first finished batch) and always once at the end of the run, including
  the `--concurrency 1` path, which before relied on the last batch's refresh.
  `--refreshInterval=0` restores the per-batch refresh (Node-identical request pattern);
  `--noRefresh` still sends no refresh and wins over `--refreshInterval`. After the run the
  same documents are visible; only readers watching *during* a restore see them up to the
  interval later. NODE-DIFFERENCES.md #26.

- **`_doc` sort for scroll dumps (1.1-3).** `--scrollDocSort` adds `"sort":["_doc"]` to a
  scroll body with no `sort` and a `match_all`/`match_none` query (or none). It is skipped,
  with an info log, for PIT, `--searchAfter`, `--scrollId`, `--searchWithTemplate`, a user
  sort, scoring queries and `track_scores`/`min_score`/`rescore`. The injected `sort` member
  is stripped from written hits; `"_score": null` remains. Default off: without the flag,
  requests and dump lines are unchanged. Node sets `sort: ['_doc']` on its request options
  object, not the body, so it never actually sends the sort and writes `"_score": 1`.
  NODE-DIFFERENCES.md #27.

- **Scroll slices capped to the shard count (1.1-4).** A sliced scroll with more slices than
  primary shards makes the engine filter every document of a shard per extra slice, which can
  be slower than an unsliced scroll. A scroll dump now reads `index.number_of_shards` of the
  input indices and lowers `--slices` to it with a warning (one shard: unsliced). The count is
  version-aware (`--sliceCap=auto`, default): Elasticsearch 7.11-9.4 assign slices across all
  shards of the request (elastic/elasticsearch#65706), so the total primary-shard count is the
  limit; Elasticsearch 5.0-7.10 and OpenSearch assign them per index, and Elasticsearch 9.5+
  scroll filters per shard again (elastic/elasticsearch#148664), so the smallest count is the
  limit there and when the version cannot be detected. The version (`GET /`) is only read when
  the input names several indices. `--sliceCap=min` / `total` force one count;
  `--sliceCap=false` keeps the requested number. `--sliceField` adds `"field"` to
  every slice (numeric/date field with doc values, checked with
  `GET /<index>/_mapping/field/<field>`; a missing, non-numeric or doc-values-less field is
  an error before the first search) and disables the cap. PIT is not capped. When the
  settings or mapping cannot be read, a warning is printed and the flags are used as given.
  Node has no slicing.

- **Compression runs on its own thread (1.1-9).** A compressed file output (`--fsCompress`,
  `--compressionType gzip|zstd`, split parts too) now feeds each part's encoder on a
  dedicated `searchdump-compress` thread, so gzip/zstd no longer stall the writer between
  batches. The compressed bytes are identical to 1.0. An encoder error surfaces on the next
  write, flush or seal; dropping a part (cancel, abort, error) stops its thread. The memory
  estimate counts 3 extra batches for compressed output. No flag.

- **Bulk encode/send overlap at `--concurrency 1` (1.1-6).** A batch is now validated and
  encoded while the previous one is in flight, then sent once that send has finished
  (written, retried or reported). Sends never overlap, so the requests and their order are
  unchanged; an error in batch N means batch N+1 is never sent. A run that ends with an
  error finishes the one batch in flight before exiting. `SEARCHDUMP_BULK_PIPELINE=0` turns
  it off (A/B switch, not a CLI flag). The version-conflict (409) and data-stream hints are
  now shared by all workers, so they are printed once per run also with `--concurrency N > 1`
  (they were printed once per batch there). The memory estimate counts 2 extra batches.

- **searchdump-multi runs its children asynchronously (1.1-8).** Child `searchdump` processes
  are awaited without holding a runtime thread per child. Ctrl-C now stops running children:
  SIGTERM first, SIGKILL after 5 s, and each stopped child is named with its log
  (`interrupted: stopped searchdump --type=data for INDEX (...)`); before, running children
  were left to finish. Exit status 130 is unchanged.

- **searchdump-multi uses the record counts its children report (1.1-7).** A data run of
  searchdump gets a hidden `--statsFile` and writes written/failed/overwritten/rejected
  counts when it succeeds. The dump summary and manifest `records` use that count; without
  it, the child's last `Total Writes: N` log line (searchdump and Node elasticdump formats);
  without both, the data files are read back as before. A load adds up each part's written +
  failed instead of reading every part before loading it. `--verifyCounts` always reads the
  files back and fails the index when the reported count differs. `--statsFile` is passed
  only when the child binary resolves to `searchdump*` (compatibility symlinks included; a
  Node `--elasticdumpBin` gets no unknown flag). `SEARCHDUMP_MULTI_DEBUG=1` prints the count
  source. Summary and manifest formats are unchanged.

- **Perf harness timer (1.1-5).** `scripts/load/measure.py` now blocks in `wait4` and samples
  `/proc` on a side thread, instead of polling `wait4` every 0.1 s. Wall times are no longer
  rounded up to the next ~0.1 s tick. Results carry `"timer": "blocking-wait4"`; 1.0.0-beta1
  numbers measured with the old harness are re-measured before any 1.1 comparison. Binaries
  are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **No whole-cluster refresh (1.1-2).** A restore with no output index (documents keep their
  `_index`) used to send `POST /_refresh`, refreshing every index in the cluster after every
  batch. It now refreshes only the indices the run wrote (after `--prefix`/`--suffix`/rename),
  as `POST /a,b,…/_refresh?ignore_unavailable=true&allow_no_indices=true`, split so each URL
  stays under ~3 KB, and sends nothing when nothing was written. With an output index the
  request is unchanged. Node elasticdump refreshes the whole cluster after every batch in
  this case (`_data.js` `reindex()` posts `${base.url}/_refresh`); this is a deliberate
  difference. The data visible after the run is the same. NODE-DIFFERENCES.md #25.

### Upgrade notes

- **Refresh default.** Scripts that need documents to become searchable after every batch
  should pass `--refreshInterval=0`. `--noRefresh` is unchanged and wins over
  `--refreshInterval`.
- **Scroll `--slices`.** A value higher than the primary-shard count is now lowered, with a
  warning (on a multi-index dump, the smallest or the total count depending on the engine
  version; see README "Tuning"). Pass `--sliceCap=false` to keep the requested number, or
  `--sliceCap=min|total` to choose the count. PIT is not capped.
- **Dump lines.** Unchanged unless `--scrollDocSort` is set (then `"_score": null`, and the
  returned `sort` member is not written). Leave the flag off to stay identical to 1.0 and
  Node.
- **searchdump-multi Ctrl-C.** Running children are now stopped (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after
  5 s). Previously they were left to finish.
- **searchdump-multi counts.** Manifest and summary formats are unchanged. Pass
  `--verifyCounts` to keep the old always-rescan check and fail the index on a mismatch.
- **Compatibility.** Dump files, `multielasticdump.json`, `SEARCHDUMP_*` / `ELASTICDUMP_*`
  names, and the `elasticdump` / `elasticdump-rs` / `multielasticdump` symlinks are
  unchanged. These changes are for 1.1 only; they are not backported to 1.0.

### Performance

Point-in-time results comparing 1.0.0-beta1 (re-measured with the 1.1 timer) and each 1.1
commit are not in yet. They will be added here and in
[`project/release/RELEASE-NOTES-1.1.md`](project/release/RELEASE-NOTES-1.1.md) when that run
finishes.

## 1.0.0-beta1

First tagged release under the new name, as a beta. Version 1.0.0 will follow after a full
regression run.

### Disclaimer

searchdump-rs is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, as stated in the MIT license
(and the Apache-2.0 license of the code it is modelled on). The authors are not liable for any
damage from its use, including data loss, corruption, downtime or service disruption, in
production or elsewhere. It has been stable and fast in our testing, but no test suite covers
every cluster version, configuration, plugin and storage backend, and a beta release in particular
may still contain bugs. Test in a non-production environment first, and verify every backup and
restore yourself (restore it, compare document counts) before you rely on it. See
[Disclaimer](README.md#disclaimer).

### Changed

- **Renamed** from elasticdump-rs-fork to searchdump-rs (repository
  github.com/robertgoley/searchdump-rs). The binaries are now `searchdump` (was `elasticdump-rs`)
  and `searchdump-multi` (was `multielasticdump`); the library crate is `searchdump_rs`.
- Environment variables are now `SEARCHDUMP_*`. The old `ELASTICDUMP_*` names still work as
  deprecated aliases and print a one-time warning; when both are set, the new name wins.
- Minimum Rust version is 1.91 (`rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.91.1).
- The default container image is the dhi.io Debian 13 image with a shell (`dhi-debian`, linux/amd64).
  The shell-less `dhi.io/static` image, the previous default, is still built as `dhi-static`.
- README rewritten: origin and credits (elasticdump-rs by TenYears, Node elasticdump), install,
  usage, compatibility notes, performance figures from recorded runs only, trademarks.

### Added

- **Object storage and SFTP** through OpenDAL 0.59: `s3://`, `b2://`, `sftp://` and `fs://` as
  `--input`/`--output` for `searchdump` and `searchdump-multi` (copy and staged dump/load),
  settings in `--inputStorageConfig`/`--outputStorageConfig` files or environment variables (no
  secrets in URLs). Tested against MinIO and RustFS (including SSE-C), OpenSSH and Dropbear SFTP,
  and the local filesystem; Backblaze B2 and AWS S3 are compile-tested only so far.
- `searchdump-multi` (formerly `multielasticdump`) ships in the release archives next to
  `searchdump`.
- Compatibility names in every container image and release archive: `elasticdump` and
  `elasticdump-rs` -> `searchdump`, `multielasticdump` -> `searchdump-multi`.
- Release workflow: archives for x86_64/aarch64 glibc and musl, SHA-256 checksums, a CycloneDX
  SBOM, GitHub build-provenance attestations, container images on ghcr.io, and a draft GitHub
  release for review.

### Known issues

- `sftp://` URLs do not work inside the container images. OpenDAL's SFTP backend runs the system OpenSSH `ssh`
  client, which the images do not include (Dropbear's client is not compatible). SFTP works with the host binaries
  and release archives on systems with OpenSSH installed. S3, B2 and `fs://` are not affected.
- Backblaze B2 (`b2://`) is compile-tested only. It has not been run against a real B2 account (pending owner
  credentials; see TESTING-TODO.md).
- The full performance-suite numbers for this tag were still being collected at release time. Earlier recorded
  runs are in [README Performance](README.md#performance); the v1.0.0-beta1 suite results will be added when that
  run finishes.

### Upgrade notes

- **Binaries.** `elasticdump-rs` is now `searchdump`, and `multielasticdump` is now `searchdump-multi`. Every
  container image and release archive also ships compatibility names: `elasticdump` and `elasticdump-rs` →
  `searchdump`, `multielasticdump` → `searchdump-multi`.
- **Environment variables.** The new names are `SEARCHDUMP_*`. The old `ELASTICDUMP_*` names still work as
  deprecated aliases and print a one-time warning; when both are set, the new name wins.
- **Manifest.** `searchdump-multi` still writes and reads the manifest file as `multielasticdump.json` (unchanged,
  so existing dump directories keep working).

### Security

- opendal 0.59.5 removes the dependency advisories RUSTSEC-2026-0194, RUSTSEC-2026-0195 and
  RUSTSEC-2026-0385; `deny.toml` and the cargo-audit configuration no longer ignore any advisory.
