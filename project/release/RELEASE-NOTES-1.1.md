# searchdump-rs 1.1 release notes (draft)

Status: draft on the local `release/1.1` branch. Not tagged and not published. Point-in-time performance
is measured (see [Performance](#performance)). These notes describe the changes already committed for 1.1.

The same material is summarised in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) under **Unreleased (1.1)**.
Known, deliberate differences from Node elasticdump are also in
[`NODE-DIFFERENCES.md`](../../NODE-DIFFERENCES.md) (#25–#27).

## Disclaimer

searchdump-rs is provided **as is, without warranty of any kind**, as set out in its
[MIT license](../../LICENSE) (the same warranty disclaimer as the elasticdump-rs code it derives
from; Node elasticdump, whose behaviour it follows, has the equivalent disclaimer in Apache-2.0,
sections 7 and 8). The authors accept no liability for any damage from its use, including data
loss, data corruption, downtime or service disruption, in production or anywhere else.

It has been stable and fast in our testing, but no test suite can cover every edge case across
cluster versions, configurations, plugins and storage backends. Before you rely on it:

- try it in a non-production environment first;
- verify every backup independently: restore it somewhere, then compare document counts (and
  spot-check documents, mappings and settings) against the source;
- keep your existing backup method until those checks pass for your own data.

See [Disclaimer](../../README.md#disclaimer).

## Highlights

- **Restores and copies spend less time refreshing.** The writer refreshes at most every 5 seconds
  (plus once at the end of the run) instead of after every bulk batch. With no output index, it
  refreshes only the indices it wrote, never the whole cluster.
- **Scroll `--slices` is capped to the shard count**, so a dump no longer asks the engine to filter
  every document of a shard once per extra slice. `--sliceField` can slice on a numeric or date
  field instead of `_id`.
- **`--scrollDocSort` is available as an opt-in** when you want Elasticsearch's cheap `_doc` scroll
  order. It stays off by default so dump lines still match Node and 1.0.
- **gzip and zstd no longer stall the writer** between batches. The compressed bytes stay identical
  to 1.0.
- **At `--concurrency 1`, the next bulk batch is prepared while one is sending.** Sends never
  overlap, so the cluster still sees the same requests in the same order.
- **`searchdump-multi` takes record counts from its children**, so a large compressed dump is no
  longer read back just to fill the manifest. Ctrl-C now stops running children. `--verifyCounts`
  keeps the old full re-read when you want it.

## New flags and defaults

| Flag | Default | Tool | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--refreshInterval=<seconds>` | `5` | `searchdump` | Refresh written indices at most this often while writing, plus once at the end of the run. Accepts seconds, optional decimals, and an optional trailing `s` (`0` to `86400`). `0` refreshes after every batch, as in 1.0 and Node. |
| `--noRefresh` | off (unchanged) | `searchdump` | Sends no refresh. Wins over `--refreshInterval`. |
| `--scrollDocSort` | off | `searchdump` | Opt-in. Adds `"sort":["_doc"]` to an unscored scroll body that has no user sort. |
| `--sliceCap=auto\|min\|total\|false` | `auto` | `searchdump` | A scroll dump lowers `--slices` to the primary-shard count of the input indices (one shard: unsliced) and prints a warning. `auto` (`true` is an alias) picks the count from the cluster version: the total on Elasticsearch 7.11–9.4, the smallest on Elasticsearch 5.0–7.10, 9.5+, OpenSearch and undetectable versions. `min` / `total` force one; `false` keeps the number you passed. |
| `--sliceField=<field>` | unset | `searchdump` | Slice on this numeric or date field with doc values, instead of `_id`. The mapping is checked first; a missing, non-numeric, or `doc_values:false` field is an error before the first search. Using this flag turns the shard-count cap off. |
| `--verifyCounts` | off | `searchdump-multi` | Always re-read dumped or loaded data and fail the index when the child's reported record count differs. |

Related switches that are not CLI flags:

- `SEARCHDUMP_BULK_PIPELINE=0` turns off encode/send overlap at `--concurrency 1` (for A/B checks).
- `SEARCHDUMP_MULTI_DEBUG=1` prints how `searchdump-multi` got each record count.
- `--statsFile` is a hidden `searchdump` flag. `searchdump-multi` passes it only to a child whose
  binary resolves to `searchdump*` (the `elasticdump` / `elasticdump-rs` compatibility symlinks
  included). A Node `--elasticdumpBin` never receives it.

## Behaviour changes versus 1.0

These compare 1.1 with the 1.0 line, including 1.0.0-beta1. Dump files, the
`multielasticdump.json` manifest, environment variable names, and the compatibility symlinks are
unchanged.

- **Refresh after every batch is no longer the default.** 1.0 refreshed the target after every
  successful bulk batch. 1.1 refreshes at most every 5 seconds (the clock starts at the first
  finished batch) and always once at the end of the run, including the `--concurrency 1` path,
  which previously relied on the last batch's refresh. After the run, the same documents are
  searchable; a reader watching *during* a restore may see new documents up to the interval later
  (the engine's own `index.refresh_interval`, 1 s by default, still applies as well). Use
  `--refreshInterval=0` for the 1.0 request pattern, or `--noRefresh` to send none.
- **A restore with no output index no longer refreshes the whole cluster.** 1.0 sent
  `POST /_refresh` in that case, which refreshes every index. 1.1 sends
  `POST /a,b,…/_refresh?ignore_unavailable=true&allow_no_indices=true` for the indices it actually
  wrote (after `--prefix` / `--suffix` / rename; data-stream creates record the stream), split so
  each URL path stays under ~3 KB, and sends nothing when nothing was written. With an output index
  the request is unchanged from 1.0.
- **`--slices` on a scroll dump is capped to the shard count on Elasticsearch 7.10.** In 1.0,
  `--slices` was used as given, even when it was higher than the primary-shard count, which made
  ES 7.10 slower than an unsliced scroll. On ES 7.10, 1.1 lowers it to the smallest primary-shard
  count of the input indices (with a warning) unless you pass `--sliceCap=false`. **Every other
  engine, and an undetectable version, keeps `--slices` as given** (1.1-4a, owner decision
  2026-11-14): the point-in-time perf run showed the cap making sliced scrolls 45–59% slower on
  ES 8.19 and 62–101% slower on OpenSearch 3 (see Performance below). `--sliceCap=min|total`
  still force the cap on any engine (Elasticsearch 7.11–9.4 spread slices across all shards of
  the request, so `total` matches them; the others slice per index). When
  settings cannot be read (for example no `view_index_metadata` privilege), the requested number is
  kept and a warning is printed. PIT (`--searchAfter --pit`) is never capped.
- **`--scrollDocSort` does not change default dumps.** Leave it off and the scroll request and the
  dump lines are the same as 1.0. With the flag on, unscored scroll hits are written with
  `"_score": null` and without the returned `sort` member; restores ignore both. The flag is
  skipped, with an info log, for PIT, `--searchAfter`, `--scrollId`, `--searchWithTemplate`, a user
  `sort`, scoring queries, and `track_scores` / `min_score` / `rescore`.
- **Compressed file output is produced on a per-part thread.** There is no flag. gzip and zstd
  bytes are identical to 1.0. The memory estimate counts three extra batches for a compressed file
  output.
- **`--concurrency 1` prepares the next bulk batch while one is in flight.** Sends still do not
  overlap. An error in batch N means batch N+1 is never sent; a run that stops with an error still
  finishes the one batch in flight. The version-conflict (409) and data-stream hints are printed
  once per run at `--concurrency N > 1` as well (1.0 printed them once per batch there). The memory
  estimate counts two extra batches.
- **`searchdump-multi` Ctrl-C stops running children.** 1.0 left them to finish unless the terminal
  also signalled them. 1.1 starts no new step, sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 5 seconds. Each
  stopped child is named with its log, and its index is recorded as failed. Exit status 130 is
  unchanged. A restore still finishes in-flight bulk requests on SIGTERM and prints where to resume.
- **`searchdump-multi` no longer always re-reads data files for counts.** It prefers the child's
  `--statsFile` JSON, then the last `Total Writes: N` (and `Failed Writes: N`) log line, and only
  then scans the files. Summary and manifest formats are unchanged. Pass `--verifyCounts` to keep
  the 1.0 always-rescan check and fail the index on a mismatch.
- **The perf harness timer is exact.** `scripts/load/measure.py` no longer rounds wall time up to
  the next ~0.1 s tick. The `searchdump` and `searchdump-multi` binaries are unchanged by that
  commit.

## Behaviour changes versus Node elasticdump

File formats stay compatible: dumps made by either tool still load with the other, and
`searchdump-multi --nodeCompat` is unchanged.

Deliberate differences introduced in 1.1:

- **Refresh cadence (NODE-DIFFERENCES #26).** Node refreshes after every bulk batch
  (`_data.js` `reindex()`). 1.1 refreshes at most every `--refreshInterval` seconds (default 5)
  plus once at the end. `--refreshInterval=0` restores Node's per-batch refresh.
- **Refresh targets (NODE-DIFFERENCES #25).** When there is no output index, Node posts
  `${base.url}/_refresh`, which refreshes **every index in the cluster** after every batch. 1.1
  refreshes only the indices it wrote. The data visible after the run is the same; unrelated
  indices are no longer refreshed. With an output index, both tools refresh that index.
- **Scroll `_doc` sort (NODE-DIFFERENCES #27).** Node sets `sort: ['_doc']` on its request
  *options* object, not the body, so it never sends a sort and writes `"_score": 1`. 1.1 matches
  that by default (no sort, identical dump lines). Opt-in `--scrollDocSort` actually sends
  `"sort":["_doc"]` and writes `"_score": null`.

No Node compatibility difference (searchdump-only behaviour, or the same requests as Node):

- `--slices`, `--sliceCap`, and `--sliceField` (Node has no slicing).
- Off-thread compression (gzip bytes identical; zstd is a searchdump extension).
- Encode/send overlap (same requests in the same order at `--concurrency 1`).
- `searchdump-multi` Ctrl-C handling (not part of the dump format or CLI contract).
- Child-reported counts (`--statsFile` is never passed to a Node binary; Node's
  `Total Writes: N` log line is still parsed).

## Upgrade guide

1.1 is the next stable line. These changes are not backported to 1.0.

- **Existing dumps keep working.** NDJSON data files, metadata files, split parts, and
  `multielasticdump.json` are unchanged. `SEARCHDUMP_*` names, the deprecated `ELASTICDUMP_*`
  aliases, and the `elasticdump` / `elasticdump-rs` / `multielasticdump` compatibility symlinks
  are unchanged.
- **If a script or watcher needs documents to become searchable after every batch**, pass
  `--refreshInterval=0` (Node-identical requests) or `--noRefresh` if you do not want a refresh
  at all. Otherwise the new 5-second default is the one you get, including from
  `searchdump-multi` data runs unless you pass another value after `--`.
- **If you restore many indices into their original names** (no `--output-index`), only those
  indices are refreshed. That is intentional. Unrelated indices on the same cluster are no longer
  touched.
- **If you pass `--slices` higher than the primary-shard count on ES 7.10** and want that number
  kept, add `--sliceCap=false`. Other engines keep it without a flag (1.1-4a). To force a limit
  on any engine, use `--sliceCap=min` or `--sliceCap=total`. Live tests that exercise over-slicing already do this. PIT is not capped.
- **Leave `--scrollDocSort` off** when you compare dump files with Node or with 1.0, or when a
  scoring query / user sort / PIT / search-after is in use (the flag already refuses those
  cases). Turn it on only when you want `_doc` order on a plain scroll dump.
- **Ctrl-C on `searchdump-multi` now stops children.** Do not rely on them running to completion
  after the parent is interrupted. Use `--resume` (and the child's log) to continue a stopped
  load.
- **Pass `--verifyCounts`** if you want `searchdump-multi` to keep re-reading every data file and
  to fail the index when that count disagrees with the child. Without it, a successful child's
  reported count is trusted for the manifest and the summary.
- **Memory estimates are slightly higher** for compressed file output (three extra batches) and
  for `--concurrency 1` encode/send overlap (two extra batches). Peak behaviour is otherwise the
  same.

## Performance

Point-in-time run finished 2026-11-14: every 1.1 commit was built and measured on Elasticsearch 7.10.2
(`es710-plain`), Elasticsearch 8.19.23 (`es819-plain`) and OpenSearch 3.9.0 (`os3-plain`), L0 dataset, three
reps, wall-clock median per case. Full tables (every case, every step, change against the previous step,
noise-aware): [`scripts/perf/results/pit-1.1.md`](../../scripts/perf/results/pit-1.1.md).

**How to read this**

- **Node comparison skipped.** Node elasticdump was not run at the 1.1 steps (`--skip-node`); the "Node" column
  in the report is the beta1-era reference on es710 only.
- **Baselines.** The 1.0.0-beta1 suite baselines come from a separate VM and are not in this report. The only
  beta1 number here is the es710 re-measure of `94e4afb` (step 0), taken *before* the box was restored on
  2026-11-12; it is the one reference for "1.1 vs beta1" and is confounded by that restore (1.1-2 shows
  +26..+48% on es710 restores that es819/os3 cannot confirm). es819 and os3 have no beta1 step, so their tables
  start at 1.1-2 and compare "last vs 1.1-2".
- **One flaky rep.** es710 step 1.1-8: `dump-split-gzip` rep 2 failed its `edverify` check (exit 2) once; the
  step is marked FAIL in the driver, the other reps were fine and the case has no 1.1-8 median in the report.
  It passed at 1.1-9, 1.1-6 and 1.1-7 and on the other engines. It was not reproduced, so it is treated as
  flaky and not attributed to 1.1-8. os3 1.1-3 was re-run after several instant harness failures (isolated
  podman store), then passed.
- A change is bold in the report only when it is at least 5% and twice the larger CV. Many cells move 10-20%
  without that, so read the per-step counts and the repeated pattern across engines, not single cells.

**Step over step** (es710 / es819 / os3; negative = faster)

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| 1.1-2 targeted refresh | Only measurable on es710 vs beta1: slower (geomean 1.31, 30 of 35 cases slower), restore-none 4.99 s to 7.17 s; restores +39..+48%. Likely box restore, not the code; not confirmed on es819/os3 (first step there). |
| 1.1-1 refresh every 5 s | The clear win, restores and copy: es710 restore-none 7.17 to 5.58 s (-22%), restore-gzip -24%, restore-small -33%; es819 restore-none 6.83 to 4.65 s (-32%), restore-gzip -28%, restore-small -32%; os3 restore-none 6.63 to 4.68 s (-29%), restore-gzip -39%, restore-zstd -41%. Dumps mostly flat (es819 dump-none -13%, os3 -22%). Faster/slower cases: 14/0, 11/2, 12/0. |
| 1.1-3 `--scrollDocSort` (opt-in, off by default) | No intended default effect; es710 restores +3..+15% (restore-zstd +15% bold), es819 restore-gzip -12% and copy -16%, os3 restore-big -23%. Faster/slower 2/6, 7/3, 7/3: noise. |
| 1.1-4 slice cap | es710: dump-scroll-s2 2.35 to 0.88 s (-63%) and s4 1.41 to 0.93 s (-34%), s8 -5%: the intended fix. es819/os3 were already fast uncapped and got slower: dump-scroll-s4 0.46 to 0.67 s (+45%) / 0.43 to 0.69 s (+62%), dump-scroll-s8 0.42 to 0.67 s (+59%) / 0.32 to 0.64 s (+101%). **1.1-4a (2026-11-14) limits the default cap to ES 7.10**, so es819/os3 are back to the pre-1.1-4 uncapped behaviour (code path identical to `--sliceCap=false` there; not re-measured with the full batch). dump-pit-s* is uncapped (es819 s4 -20%, s8 -13%). |
| 1.1-9 compression thread | No clear gain: es710 dump-gzip -5%, dump-zstd +10%; es819 dump-gzip +5%, dump-split-gzip +14% (bold); os3 dump-zstd +24% (bold), dump-split-gzip -6%. Faster/slower 1/3, 7/10, 6/5. |
| 1.1-6 encode overlap | Restores gain on ES: es710 restore-none 5.47 to 4.52 s (-17%), restore-gzip -21%; es819 restore-none -16%, restore-zstd -19%. os3 shows no gain (restore-none +15%, gzip -4%, zstd -6%). Faster/slower 10/1, 8/4, 4/5. |
| 1.1-8 tokio::process | Within noise for `searchdump-multi`: es710 multi-restore-p1 +19% (bold), multi-restore-p8 +13%; es819 multi-restore-p8 +19% (n.s.); os3 multi-restore-p1 +25% (bold), multi-dump-p1 -17%. Faster/slower 3/8, 4/6, 12/4. |
| 1.1-7 child counts | No cost seen without `--verifyCounts`: es710 multi-restore-p1 -11% (bold), es819 multi-restore-p8 -20% and multi-dump-p8 -18% (bold); os3 multi-dump-p4 +49%, p8 +47% (os3 1 faster / 14 slower, most small). |

Net, last step against the first measured one (geomean wall ratio): es710 1.08 vs beta1 (1.31 at 1.1-2),
es819 0.85 and os3 0.91 vs 1.1-2. The README Performance tables in
[README Performance](../../README.md#performance) are still the older 0.1 s-timer numbers and are not 1.1 numbers.
