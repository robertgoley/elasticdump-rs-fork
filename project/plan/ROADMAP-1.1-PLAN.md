# searchdump-rs 1.1: implementation plan (for review)

Status: **steps 1-9 approved and committed without building** (see Status below); compile/test and point-in-time perf run pending. Branch `release/1.1` is on GitHub as `origin/release/1.1` (UNCOMPILED / UNTESTED). Do not merge to `main` without Robert.
Scope: roadmap items 1.1-1 to 1.1-9 from `FEATURES-TODO.md`, section "Roadmap: 1.1 release (performance and robustness)".
Line references were rechecked at `0847643` (main, 2026-11-11). The roadmap table quotes them as of `a98be22`.

Rules that still apply: Rust 1.91 minimum (`rust-version = "1.91"`). No secrets in the repo; credentials appear only as blank variable references. Opt-in flags use Node-style camelCase names. Every change keeps or extends the existing tests.

## Status

Owner go-ahead for steps 1-4 on 2026-11-11 (t163u), and for steps 5-9 the same way (commit without building, then one batch of per-commit point-in-time perf tests; t166u/t167u). 1.0.0 is stable with no backports (Q5); 1.1 is the next stable. Q3: scroll slices are capped with a warning. Q1 and Q2 were not answered, so the recommended defaults are used: Q1 interval refresh every 5 s plus a final refresh (`--refreshInterval=0` = Node's per-batch refresh); Q2 option (c), opt-in `--scrollDocSort`.

| Step | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.1-5 perf timer | in progress (release/1.1): harness change committed; offline selftests pass; beta1@timer2 re-measure pending |
| 2 | 1.1-2 targeted refresh | in progress (release/1.1): code + unit/contract tests committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); A/B pending |
| 3 | 1.1-1 refresh cadence | in progress (release/1.1): code + unit/contract tests committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); A/B pending |
| 4 | 1.1-3 `_doc` sort (opt-in) | in progress (release/1.1): opt-in --scrollDocSort + unit/contract tests committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); nodecmp + A/B pending |
| 5 | 1.1-4 slice cap + `--sliceField` | in progress (release/1.1): committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); point-in-time perf pending |
| 6 | 1.1-9 compression thread | in progress (release/1.1): committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); point-in-time perf pending |
| 7 | 1.1-6 encode overlap | in progress (release/1.1): committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); point-in-time perf pending |
| 8 | 1.1-8 tokio::process | in progress (release/1.1): committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); point-in-time perf pending |
| 9 | 1.1-7 child counts | in progress (release/1.1): committed; compiled and tested 2026-11-12 (wip/1.1-fixups); point-in-time perf pending |

"In progress" means committed on `release/1.1` but not yet A/B measured. Compile (`pit.sh check`) and HEAD tests/clippy/selftest passed on 2026-11-12 after two folded fixups (see `project/HANDOFF-1.1.md`).

## Point-in-time test plan (all nine steps, one batch)

Owner decision (t166u/t167u): the 1.1 steps were committed without building; they are compiled, tested and measured
together afterwards, one build per commit, so each step's effect can be read off against the one before it.
Start only when the beta1 suite has finished (`pgrep -f run-all.sh` empty, all 16 `steps/*.done`). Everything runs
niced from `/workspace/rel-1.1` at the head of `release/1.1`; nothing touches `fix-wt`, `perf-b1` or
`perf-bin-beta1`.

Steps (`scripts/perf/pit.sh list`): v1.0.0-beta1 and every later commit that changes Rust code (`src`, `tools`,
`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`). Since beta1 only the 1.1 commits do; `4cffbf4` (1.1-5, harness only) and the plan/docs
commits are skipped, and the 1.1-5 timer is in effect for every step because the harness always comes from the head.

| # | Step | Commit | `PERF_HOST_ID` | Expect against the previous step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | beta1 | `94e4afb` | `grokbox-beta1-timer2` | reference (also measures Node) |
| 1 | 1.1-2 | `04e0af0` | `grokbox-1.1-04e0af0` | no change in the suite (its cases name an output index; refresh targets only matter without one) |
| 2 | 1.1-1 | `d280836` | `grokbox-1.1-d280836` | large win on `restore-*`, `restore-split-*`, `copy`, `multi-restore-p*`; `restore-norefresh`/`copy-norefresh` unchanged |
| 3 | 1.1-3 | `87d1781` | `grokbox-1.1-87d1781` | no change (opt-in flag): a noise check |
| 4 | 1.1-4 | `aee5dfb` | `grokbox-1.1-aee5dfb` | `dump-scroll-s2/s4/s8` drop to about `dump-scroll-s1` (1-shard index, now unsliced); `dump-pit-s*` unchanged |
| 5 | 1.1-9 | `7ebd7d0` | `grokbox-1.1-7ebd7d0` | small win on `dump-gzip`, `dump-zstd`, `dump-split-gzip`, `dump-split-zstd` (wall; CPU moves to a thread) |
| 6 | 1.1-6 | `99d5cb8` | `grokbox-1.1-99d5cb8` | 10-20 % on `restore-none/gzip/zstd`, `copy` (`--concurrency 1`); nothing else |
| 7 | 1.1-8 | `0e00d92` | `grokbox-1.1-0e00d92` | `multi-*-p1/p4/p8`: no regression, p8 may scale better |
| 8 | 1.1-7 | `7910c9a` | `grokbox-1.1-7910c9a` | `multi-dump-p*` a little faster (no read-back); same records in the manifest |

Hashes change if fixups are folded in; `pit.sh list` always prints the current ones.

Phases (each resumable; markers under `PIT_STATE`, default `/workspace/perf-pit-1.1`):

1. Compile every step: `scripts/perf/pit.sh check` (`cargo check --all-targets --locked` per commit in a temporary
   worktree, shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/workspace/pit-target`). A step that does not compile gets a
   `git commit --fixup=<hash>` on the head, then `git rebase -i --autosquash v1.0.0-beta1` (local branch, never
   pushed) so that every commit builds; rerun `check`. About 25 min (first step ~8 min, then 1-2 min each).
2. Tests at the head, niced, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/workspace/rel-1.1/target`: `cargo test` (unit, `cli_contract`,
   `golden_replay`, `chaos_brk`), `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `python3 -m unittest selftest` in
   `scripts/perf`. Fixes again as fixups folded into their item's commit. About 30-40 min.
3. Release binaries: `scripts/perf/pit.sh build` -> `/workspace/perf-bin-1.1/<shorthash>/` (searchdump,
   searchdump-multi, edgen, edverify, plus `.complete` with the commit and sha256s). Release profile (LTO), as
   shipped: about 10 min per step at `-j2`, ~1.5 h for nine. (`PIT_PROFILE=it` halves it but is not the shipped
   profile; then build all nine with it.)
4. Measure: `PIT_ENV=<copy of the beta1 driver's env file> PIT_REAP_CONMON=... PIT_REAP_PASTA=... scripts/perf/pit.sh run`.
   Engines `es710-plain es819-plain os3-plain`, `--tier L0 --place box --reps 3`, `PERF_AB_CASES=1`, a baseline
   directory with no files (`results/perf/pit-baselines`, so no identity checks against older baselines). Engine
   by engine, all nine steps back to back, so neighbouring steps share box conditions. Node is measured only at
   step 0 (`PIT_NODE=base`). Time per engine run from the beta1 suite: ~17-18 min with Node, ~12-13 min without
   (Node is ~90 s of the ~160 s per rep). Total: 3 x 18 min + 24 x 12.5 min = about 6 h.
5. Report: `scripts/perf/pit.sh aggregate` -> `PIT_STATE/pit-report.md`: per engine, one row per case and one column
   per step (searchdump wall median and the change against the previous step, bold beyond max(5 %, 2 x CV)), Node at
   step 0 for reference, and a per-step summary (geometric-mean ratio against beta1; cases faster/slower beyond noise).

End to end about 8.5 h of box time (phases 1-3 about 2.5 h, phase 4 about 6 h). Cheaper variants: `PIT_REPS=2`
(about -1.5 h), or two engines (about -2 h).

Item checks that the suite does not cover, after phase 2:

* 1.1-3: a `--scrollDocSort` A/B on `dump-none`/`dump-big` (manual) and `scripts/load/nodecmp.py` on `dump-none`:
  `_score: null` and no `sort` are the only differences with the flag, none without it.
* Golden cases with the new refresh default: `scripts/golden/record.sh <profile> --check` on one engine
  (`data-restore`/`bulk-gzip` pass `--refreshInterval=0`).
* 1.1-4: the live IT tests that slice on purpose pass `--sliceCap=false`; run `tests/it` api/data/smoke on one engine.
* 1.1-8: a manual Ctrl-C of `searchdump-multi --parallel 4` mid-restore: children named as stopped, exit 130.
* 1.1-7: `searchdump-multi` dump with `--verifyCounts` on the many-index dataset: no count mismatch.

## 0. Gate: the beta1 baseline comes first

* **Nothing lands until the beta1 baseline is complete.** The 16-engine L0 suite (`/workspace/perf-b1/run-all.sh`, `PERF_HOST_ID=grokbox-beta1`) has to finish and be aggregated into `scripts/perf/results/v1.0.0-beta1-L0.md`.
* While that suite runs, the box gets **no cargo builds or tests and no podman**, so the timings stay clean. Until then the only work is planning and reading code on this branch.
* Every 1.1 item is an A/B against that baseline:
  * A: `/workspace/perf-bin-beta1`.
  * B: the release build of `release/1.1` at the item's commit.
  * Both run on the same host, with the same tier and `--reps 3` (use 5 for cases under 3 s until 1.1-5 lands).
  * The B run uses its own host id, for example `PERF_HOST_ID=grokbox-1.1-<item>`, so its results never mix with the baseline.
* A change is accepted when its target cases improve beyond noise and no other case regresses by more than 5 % (or beyond the rep spread, whichever is larger) on the engines used.
* **Engine subset per item:**
  * Use the "quick trio" `es710-plain`, `es819-plain` and `os3-plain` for each item. That covers old ES, current ES and OpenSearch.
  * The full 16-engine run is for release candidates only (see Phase 5).
* 1.1-5 changes the harness, so the beta1 binaries are **re-measured with the new harness** before any other A/B (see question Q4).

## 1. Proposed order

| Step | Item | Phase | Effort | Main files | Why at this point |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.1-5 perf timer resolution | 1: measure | S | `scripts/load/measure.py` | Every later A/B depends on honest wall times; today they are multiples of ~0.1 s |
| 2 | 1.1-2 targeted refresh, no whole-cluster `_refresh` | 2: refresh | S | `src/pipeline/bulk.rs` | A bug (cluster load). Same function as 1.1-1, and it adds the "indices written" set that 1.1-1 reuses. Lowest risk |
| 3 | 1.1-1 refresh cadence | 2: refresh | S | `src/pipeline/bulk.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/lib.rs` | Largest expected win (2-4x restore/copy). Needs step 2's index set. Decides a Node-compat default (Q1) |
| 4 | 1.1-3 `_doc` sort for scroll | 3: retrieval | S | `src/retrieval/search_body.rs`, `src/retrieval/mod.rs`, `src/retrieval/extract.rs` | Independent and small, but it changes dump output bytes (Q2), so it goes after the refresh work and gets its own parity check |
| 5 | 1.1-4 cap slices to shard count, `--sliceField` | 3: retrieval | M | `src/retrieval/mod.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/http/info.rs` | Touches the same slice/body setup as step 4, so it goes right after it. Needs a version-boundary investigation |
| 6 | 1.1-9 compression off the writer task | 4: pipeline CPU | S-M | `src/pipeline/file_sink.rs` | Self-contained, with output that can be checked byte for byte. Its win is visible mainly at L1 sizes |
| 7 | 1.1-6 encode next bulk batch while one is in flight | 4: pipeline CPU | M | `src/pipeline/bulk.rs` | Riskiest change in the hottest file. Done after 1.1-1/1.1-2 so it doesn't conflict with them, and so refresh no longer hides the overlap win |
| 8 | 1.1-8 `tokio::process` children in searchdump-multi | 5: multi | M | `src/bin/searchdump-multi.rs`, `Cargo.toml` (tokio `process` feature) | Restructures the child runner. Goes before 1.1-7 because 1.1-7 changes what the runner returns |
| 9 | 1.1-7 child-reported record counts | 5: multi | M (S if log-line based) | `src/bin/searchdump-multi.rs`, maybe `src/lib.rs` | Builds on the async runner from step 8. Keeps `count_records` as the fallback |
| 10 | Release-candidate check | 5 | — | — | Full 16-engine L0 run of `release/1.1` against the beta1 baseline, plus the parity checks. Report written to `scripts/perf/results/v1.1.0-rc-L0.md` |

How the order follows from the criteria:

* **Measurement first:** 1.1-5 comes first.
* **Dependencies:** 1.1-2 comes before 1.1-1 (shared index set and `refresh()`), and 1.1-8 before 1.1-7 (the runner shape).
* **Risk:** the S-sized bug fix and the large win come early. The two M-sized concurrency changes (1.1-6 and 1.1-8) come late, once the measurements are stable.
* **Node-compat risk:** the items that change behaviour (1.1-1 and 1.1-3) are isolated behind Robert's decisions (Q1 and Q2), and each is a separate commit that can be reverted on its own.
* **File overlap:**
  * `bulk.rs` items run one after another: 1.1-2, then 1.1-1, then 1.1-6.
  * Retrieval items run one after another: 1.1-3, then 1.1-4.
  * `searchdump-multi.rs` items run one after another: 1.1-8, then 1.1-7.
  * `file_sink.rs` (1.1-9) overlaps with nothing.

Each item is one commit on `release/1.1` (or two: tests, then the change), with a one-paragraph perf note in its message. Robert asked (t174u) that the branch be pushed as `origin/release/1.1`. Do not merge to `main` without Robert.

## 2. Item details

### 1.1-5: Perf timer resolution (S), step 1

* **Where:**
  * `scripts/load/measure.py` lines ~177-185: a `while True` loop runs `proc_sample()`, then `os.wait4(pid, WNOHANG)`, then `time.sleep(0.1)`.
  * The roadmap says `scripts/perf/measure.py`, but the file is under `scripts/load/`.
* **Approach:**
  * The main thread blocks in `os.wait4(p.pid, 0)`, which still returns rusage.
  * A daemon sampler thread runs `proc_sample()` every 0.1 s until an Event is set.
  * Wall time is `time.monotonic()` taken right after `wait4` returns.
  * The sampler tolerates `/proc/<pid>` vanishing.
  * Nothing else changes in the output JSON.
  * Optionally add `"timer": "blocking-wait4"` to the result so aggregate.py can refuse to compare old and new harness runs without a flag.
* **Datasets:** optionally grow the L0 `logs` dataset so that the main cases run for 3 s or more (see Q4).
* **Compat:** harness only; the binaries don't change.
* **Tests:**
  * Add a `scripts/perf/selftest.py` case that measures `sleep 0.23` and asserts that wall time falls within 0.23 to 0.26 s and is not a multiple of 0.1.
  * Add an exit-code and rusage regression check.
* **Measure:**
  * Re-run beta1 binaries on the quick trio with the new harness, giving the "beta1@timer2" baseline.
  * Check that the rep-to-rep spread for short cases (`dump-small`, `mapping-*`, `settings-*`) drops.

### 1.1-2: No whole-cluster refresh when there is no output index (S), step 2

* **Where:** `src/pipeline/bulk.rs`:
  * `refresh()` at ~1102-1121 falls back to `POST /_refresh` when `opts.index` is `None`.
  * The per-batch call is at ~878-884, and the drain-time call at ~622-626.
  * `index_for()` at ~634 resolves each document's target index, with prefix and suffix, at ~660.
* **Approach:**
  * Record every resolved target index name in a set shared by the workers. `worker()` (~549) already clones Arcs.
  * `refresh()` sends `POST /<i1>,<i2>,…/_refresh?ignore_unavailable=true&allow_no_indices=true`.
  * Index lists are split so each URL stays under ~3 KB.
  * When `opts.index` is set, the behaviour is unchanged.
  * Data streams and aliases are valid refresh targets as written.
* **Compat:**
  * Node does the same whole-cluster refresh (`_data.js reindex()` posts `${base.url}/_refresh`, where `base.url` is the cluster URL when no index is given).
  * This is therefore a deliberate divergence, but every written index is still refreshed, so what a later reader can see is unchanged.
  * Recommendation: make it the default with no flag, and record it in the compat notes in README/FEATURES.
* **Tests:**
  * Unit test with a mock server: a multi-index restore with no `--output-index` sends `/a,b/_refresh` and never `/_refresh`.
  * URL chunking with many indices.
  * The prefix/suffix rename is reflected in the refreshed names.
* **Measure:**
  * Cases `restore-none` and `multi-restore-p1/p4/p8` on the quick trio.
  * Check the `refresh_total` delta on unrelated indices, which should be 0. measure.py's cluster sampler can be extended to read `_stats/refresh`.

### 1.1-1: Refresh cadence (S), step 3

* **Where:**
  * `src/pipeline/bulk.rs` ~878 (per-batch refresh after every successful batch) and ~614-628 (`drain()` refreshes only when `concurrency > 1`).
  * `src/cli.rs` ~238 (`--noRefresh`) and `src/lib.rs` ~459 (`refresh: !cli.no_refresh()`).
* **Approach:**
  * Replace `refresh: bool` with `RefreshPolicy { Off, EveryBatch, Interval(Duration) }`.
  * `Interval` refreshes when at least the interval has passed since the last refresh, using a shared `Instant` behind the existing `refresh_lock`.
  * `drain()` **always** does one final refresh unless the policy is `Off`. That fixes the current `concurrency == 1` path, which relies on the last batch's refresh.
  * Reuse 1.1-2's index set.
* **Flags:**
  * `--refreshInterval=<dur>`, where `0` means every batch.
  * `--noRefresh` stays and takes precedence.
  * The default depends on **Q1**. Recommendation: `5s` by default, with `--refreshInterval=0` documented as "Node-identical".
* **Compat:**
  * Node refreshes after every batch (`_data.js` ~267 calls `reindex()` after each write).
  * At the end of a run the data visible is identical. Only readers watching *during* a restore see it later.
* **Tests:**
  * Policy unit tests with `tokio::time::pause`, covering refresh counts for N batches under each policy and that the final refresh always happens.
  * Concurrency 1 and greater.
  * `--noRefresh` still sends zero refreshes.
* **Measure:**
  * Add perf cases `restore-norefresh` and `copy-norefresh` (A/B upper bound).
  * Compare `restore-*`, `copy` and `restore-split-*` on the quick trio.
  * Expect 2-4x at L0, from ~17.8k docs/s for a single restore today.

### 1.1-3: `_doc` sort for scroll (S), step 4

* **Where:**
  * `src/retrieval/search_body.rs` ~10-12 (`default_search_body`) and ~34-65 (`finalize_search_body`).
  * Applied only on the scroll path chosen in `src/retrieval/mod.rs` (~325-336).
  * PIT and `search_after` already sort on `_shard_doc` (`pit_search.rs`), so they are not changed.
* **Approach:**
  * When the search type is scroll and the user's body has no `sort`, insert `"sort":["_doc"]`.
  * A user-supplied `sort` is never touched.
* **Compat:**
  * Node sets `sort: ['_doc']` on the *request options object* (`_data.js` ~115), not the body, so Node actually sends **no** sort.
  * Our hits are written raw. With `_doc` sort, each hit gets `"_score": null` and a `"sort":[n]` member, so the dump lines would differ from Node's output (`_score: 1`, no `sort`).
  * Restore ignores both fields, but byte-for-byte parity checks would flag them. **Q2** decides between:
    * (a) on by default, with the injected `sort` member stripped from output hits and `_score: null` accepted;
    * (b) on by default with both normalised (strip `sort`, rewrite `_score` to 1.0), which costs a small extra rewrite per hit;
    * (c) opt-in `--scrollDocSort`.
  * Recommendation: (a) or (c). A scoring query (non-`match_all`) whose user wants scores must keep its scores, so the injection is skipped whenever the query is not `match_all`/`match_none`, or when `--searchBodyTemplate` is used.
* **Tests:**
  * `search_body.rs` unit tests for the default body, a user body with sort, a user body without sort, and PIT/search_after untouched.
  * An `extract.rs` test that the injected `sort` is stripped.
  * A nodecmp/parity run (`scripts/load/nodecmp.py`) on `dump-none` to confirm that the documented differences are the only ones.
* **Measure:** `dump-none`, `dump-big` and `dump-scroll-s1..s8` on the quick trio. The gain grows with index size, so L1 shows it best.

### 1.1-4: Cap slices to the shard count, plus optional `--sliceField` (M), step 5

* **Where:**
  * `src/retrieval/mod.rs` ~325-346 (slice count and worker clamp) and ~520-530 (`"slice": {"id","max"}`).
  * `src/cli.rs` ~542-544 (`--slices`).
  * Engine/version info in `src/http/info.rs`.
* **Approach:**
  * Before planning slices, read the primary-shard counts of the target indices (`GET /<index>/_search_shards`, or `_cat/shards?h=index,prirep`).
  * When `--slices` is greater than the smallest per-index primary count, warn or cap (**Q3**).
  * Confirm the engine/version boundary where slices above the shard count fall back to the `_id`-hash filter (ES before ~7.16; also check OS 1.3/2.x/3.x). Use the existing `dump-scroll-s{1,2,4,8}` and `dump-pit-s*` cases on 1-shard and multi-shard indices for this.
  * `--sliceField=<numeric doc-values field>` adds `"field"` to the slice object, so the user picks a cheap field. It is validated against the mapping with a clear error if the field is missing or has no doc values.
* **Compat:**
  * `--slices` is our extension, and Node has no slicing, so there is no Node risk.
  * Capping changes behaviour only for inputs that were slower anyway.
* **Tests:**
  * Mock-server tests: a 1-shard index with `--slices 2` gives the warning and the cap; `--sliceField` appears in the body.
  * A missing field gives an error.
  * A multi-index pattern uses the smallest count.
* **Measure:** `dump-scroll-s2/s4/s8` and `dump-pit-s*` on es710-plain (the known 2.1-2.2 s vs 0.8-0.9 s case), es819-plain and os3-plain.

### 1.1-9: Compression off the writer task, with a recycled buffer (S-M), step 6

* **Where:** `src/pipeline/file_sink.rs`:
  * `GZ_DRAIN = 256 KiB` at ~16.
  * `Encoder` at ~50-85.
  * `Part::write`/`flush`/`seal` at ~329-358. `std::mem::take(enc.pending())` sits at ~334 and ~345.
* **Approach:**
  * Give each `Part` a dedicated encoder thread (a `std::thread`, or `spawn_blocking` holding the encoder), fed through a bounded channel of input chunks.
  * Compressed output comes back through a second bounded channel. Two or three `Vec<u8>` buffers circulate between the threads, so the drain allocates nothing.
  * `flush`/`seal` send a control message and wait for the matching output.
  * Errors are carried back and surface on the next write or the seal.
  * Cancel drops the channels and joins the thread.
  * zstd multithread mode (the `zstdmt` feature) is **not** in scope, because it adds a C build feature and goes through the supply-chain gates. It can be noted as a follow-up.
* **Compat:** compressed bytes are identical, because the same encoder sees the same input in the same order. No flag is needed.
* **Tests:**
  * Byte-identical output against the current path for gzip-6 and zstd-3 across fixed inputs (proptest over chunk sizes).
  * Split parts and seal ordering.
  * An error injected in the encoder surfaces.
  * Cancellation leaves no thread behind.
* **Measure:**
  * `dump-gzip`, `dump-zstd`, `dump-split-gzip` and `dump-split-zstd` on the quick trio, plus writer CPU from rusage.
  * The gain is small at L0. It needs an L1 run (local or on the box) to show the effect (Q4).

### 1.1-6: Encode the next bulk batch while one is in flight (M), step 7

* **Where:** `src/pipeline/bulk.rs`:
  * `write_batch` at ~586-611: with `concurrency <= 1` it calls `process_batch` inline.
  * `process_batch` at ~814.
  * `encode_doc` at ~671.
  * `write_chunk` at ~886.
* **Approach:**
  * Split `process_batch` into `encode(buf) -> EncodedBatch` (CPU only) and `send(EncodedBatch)` (network, retries, item errors).
  * At `--concurrency 1`, keep a one-deep pipeline:
    * encode batch N+1;
    * await the in-flight send of batch N;
    * start sending N+1.
  * Sends never overlap, so cluster ordering and the retry/`--ignore-errors` semantics are unchanged.
  * Error handling: an error from batch N cancels N+1 before it is sent.
  * `next_doc` and the per-document indices are computed at encode time, as `write_batch` does today.
  * Memory: at most two encoded batches. memplan (`src/memplan.rs`) must count the second buffer.
* **Compat:** no wire or ordering change. No flag is needed, but an env or hidden switch to disable it helps during the A/B.
* **Tests:**
  * Mock server: request order at concurrency 1 is unchanged.
  * A failure on batch N means N+1 is never sent.
  * `--ignore-errors` counts are unchanged.
  * A cancel mid-flight works.
  * Existing `encode_doc` proptests pass.
  * A memplan test for the extra buffer.
* **Measure:** `restore-none`, `restore-gzip` and `copy` at `--concurrency 1` on the quick trio, after 1.1-1 (otherwise refresh dominates). Target: 10-20 %.

### 1.1-8: `tokio::process` children in searchdump-multi (M), step 8

* **Where:** `src/bin/searchdump-multi.rs`:
  * `Runner::run_as` at ~1353-1388: `std::process::Command` at ~1368, blocking `.status()` at ~1379.
  * Call sites in `block_in_place` at ~1590, ~1685, ~1738, ~1786, ~1821 and ~1864.
  * The Ctrl-C handler at ~2183 only sets `cancelled`, so running children go on until they finish.
* **Cargo.toml:** add the `process` feature to tokio (~32-41). tokio is already a dependency, so this adds no new crate; check the SBOM/deny gates.
* **Approach:**
  * `run_as` becomes `async`, using `tokio::process::Command` with `kill_on_drop(true)`.
  * It uses `select!` between `child.wait()` and a cancel `Notify`/`CancellationToken` (tokio-util is already a dependency).
  * On cancel, send SIGTERM, wait a grace period (5 s), then SIGKILL, and log which children were stopped.
  * Remove the `block_in_place` wrappers.
* **Compat:** CLI and behaviour are unchanged, except that Ctrl-C now stops running children promptly and reports them. Record this in the README.
* **Tests:**
  * With a fake child binary (a shell script that sleeps), cancel kills it within the grace period.
  * A non-zero exit still reports the log tail.
  * `--parallel 16` with sleeping children does not starve the runtime (a timer task keeps ticking).
* **Measure:**
  * `multi-dump-p1/p4/p8` and `multi-restore-p1/p4/p8` on the quick trio. Expect no regression and better scaling at p8.
  * A manual Ctrl-C check.

### 1.1-7: Child-reported record counts in searchdump-multi (M; S with the log-line option), step 9

* **Where:** `src/bin/searchdump-multi.rs`:
  * `count_records` at ~1001 decompresses the whole file.
  * It is used at ~1605 (dump summary) and ~1807 (split-part restore totals).
* **Approach:**
  * After 1.1-8, the runner returns a `ChildStats`.
  * Preferred source: a small JSON written by the child through a hidden `--statsFile=<path>` flag. `src/lib.rs` already computes `report.written` and prints "Total Writes" at ~1155/1173.
  * Fallback 1: parse `Total Writes: N` from the child's log. Node elasticdump prints the same line, so this also works with `--elasticdump_bin` pointing at Node.
  * Fallback 2: the existing `count_records` scan, used when both are missing or when `--verifyCounts` is set. That flag is an option to keep the full check available.
* **Compat:**
  * The summary/manifest format is unchanged.
  * The count source is logged at debug level.
  * Split dumps report per-run totals; per-part counts need the stats file, or the scan when that is missing.
* **Tests:**
  * Stats-file round trip.
  * Log-line parse for the Rust and Node formats.
  * Fallback to the scan when both are absent.
  * The existing `count_records` test at ~2761 stays.
* **Measure:** `multi-dump-p*` with gzip/zstd. The win is minutes on dumps of 100 GB or more, and is negligible at L0, so check correctness at L0 and time it at L1 if Q4 allows.

## 3. Open questions for Robert

1. **Q1, refresh default (1.1-1):** should the new default be interval refresh (recommended: every 5 s plus a final refresh, with `--refreshInterval=0` restoring Node's refresh-every-batch), or should we keep Node's per-batch default and make the interval opt-in?
2. **Q2, `_doc` sort output (1.1-3):** should `_doc` sort be on by default for scroll dumps with no user sort? On by default means hits show `_score: null`, and we strip the injected `sort` field. The alternative is to make it opt-in (`--scrollDocSort`) to keep Node-identical dump lines.
3. **Q3, slices above the shard count (1.1-4):** should we cap automatically to the primary-shard count with a warning (recommended), or only warn and run as asked?
4. **Q4, baseline and dataset size:**
   * After the timer fix, should the beta1 binaries be re-measured on the quick trio only (recommended), or on all 16 engines?
   * May we add a larger L0 dataset or an L1 run (box disk/time) so that 1.1-9, 1.1-3 and 1.1-7 can show their wins?
5. **Q5, the 1.1-2 bug and 1.0.0:**
   * Should the whole-cluster refresh fix be backported to the 1.0.0 final (it is a correctness/cluster-load bug), or wait for 1.1?
   * Should `release/1.1` merge to `main` only after 1.0.0 is tagged?

## 4. Effort summary

| Item | Effort |
|---|---|
| 1.1-5 timer | S |
| 1.1-2 targeted refresh | S |
| 1.1-1 refresh cadence | S |
| 1.1-3 `_doc` sort | S |
| 1.1-4 slice cap + `--sliceField` | M (S if warn-only, no `--sliceField`) |
| 1.1-9 compression thread | S-M |
| 1.1-6 encode overlap | M |
| 1.1-8 tokio::process | M |
| 1.1-7 child counts | M (S with the log-line source only) |

S means under a day and M a few days. Coding total: about 2-3 weeks. The perf A/B runs take about 1-2 h per item on the quick trio, and the release-candidate run takes as long as the beta1 suite (most of a day).
